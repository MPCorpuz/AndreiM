       <ul>
	    <li>He is a villain, but i like his character design and i love how he fights for himself, for a reason. Follows the rules and the leader as long as it is suited for his own goals</li>
	    <li>Even though he is a villain he still has a good side,like his insistence on honorble duels and fighting fairly and never forgets favors.</li>
		<li>He is cunning, blunt and sarcastic.</li>
